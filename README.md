# BrownFi MOVE

This repo is a MOVE codebase of BrownFi AMM intented to deploy on Sui blockchain.  
BrownFi has invented a novel oracle-based AMM with high capital efficiency and NO out-of-range. This thanks to a novel price mechanism which parameterizes legacy order-book model and is published in our research paper. BrownFi has high CE as Uniswap V3 and 200X higher than Uniswap V2. Additionally, BrownFi offers a simple UX (like Uniswap V2), suitable for both retail and professional LPs.  
BrownFi team consists of OGs and talents in blockchain and crypto space with 6+ years of experience. We developed and successfully launched multiple products: infra & tools, NFT marketplace, gaming launchpad, AMM and DeFi protocols. Via BrownFi AMM, we aim to unlock deep liquidity and high capital efficiency on SUI, a very new and emerging layer-1 ecosystem.
